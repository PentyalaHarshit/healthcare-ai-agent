## Overview

**Healthcare AI Agent** is a conversational, multi-agent healthcare assistant that helps patients:

1. Describe their symptoms through a guided multi-turn chat
2. Receive an AI-driven **risk score** (0–100) with **explainable AI (XAI)** reasoning
3. Get **RAG-powered medical context** retrieved from a curated knowledge base
4. Find and **book available doctors** matched by specialty and hospital
5. Receive a **priority classification** (Normal / High / Emergency)

The system uses a **Router Agent** to classify incoming queries and route them to the appropriate agent pipeline.

## How It Works

### 1. Router Agent
Classifies incoming messages as `healthcare` or `general` based on keyword matching (e.g., "chest pain", "doctor", "hospital").

### 2. Risk Prediction
Scores symptoms on a 0–100 scale:

| Symptom | Risk Points |
|---|---|
| Chest Pain | +40 |
| Shortness of Breath | +30 |
| Diabetes | +25 |
| High Blood Pressure | +20 |
| Fever | +15 |
| Age ≥ 60 | +10 |

### 3. Priority Classification

| Score | Priority |
|---|---|
| ≥ 90 | 🔴 Emergency |
| 60–89 | 🟡 High |
| < 60 | 🟢 Normal |

### 4. Specialty Routing

| Symptoms | Specialty |
|---|---|
| Chest pain / Diabetes | Cardiology |
| Breathing / Shortness of breath | Pulmonology |
| Other | General |

### 5. XAI Explanations
Each risk factor is explained individually, providing full transparency into why a risk score was assigned — no black box.

### 6. RAG Medical Context
Top-3 relevant medical facts are retrieved from the knowledge base using keyword overlap scoring and presented alongside the risk report.
